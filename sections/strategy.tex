\section{Analysis strategy}

In order to find Higgs boson candidates we will first need to reconstruct the four leptons in the final state. We will do this by writing a \CCSPStlye{Selector} (section \ref{selector}).

%, which will filter out all physics objects that do not fulfill the selection criteria. In this selector, we will implement \underline{kinematic cuts}, \underline{vertex cuts} and \underline{Isolation \& ID} criteria. We will also implement \underline{trigger selections} such that only events interesting for the $ZZ$ analysis are selected.
