\section{Writing a Producer}\label{sec:producer}

The \CCSPStlye{Producer} class is used to calculate higher-level observables and define new columns to be written o disk. The corresponding task is called \CCSPStlye{cf.ProduceColumns} (see Ref.~\cite{cf_repo} for detailed info). Naturally, we only want to compute these new variables for the relevant events for our analysis. Thus, the producers are executed after the selection step. 

In this part of the tutorial, we will write a producer which calculates the four lepton invariant mass.
