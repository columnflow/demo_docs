\justifying
\paragraph{}
The goal of this exercise is to reconstruct the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson mass, using a selection targeting the four-lepton final state. This is considered a \textit{golden} channel to rediscovered the Higgs because:
\begin{itemize}
    \item there is a \textbf{\underline{ large signal to background ratio}} -- it is easy to discriminate between the peak of the reconstructed four-lepton mass ($m_{4l}$) and the overall flat background shape; 
    \item we have excellent \textbf{\underline{ mass resolution}} -- thanks to the great resolution power of CMS, we have optimal shape reconstruction of $m_{4l}$;
    \item it is a \textbf{\underline{ resolved final state}} -- detection of the four leptons in the final state ensures good discrimination of signal and background.
\end{itemize}
